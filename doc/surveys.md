# Running test surveys on GOV.UK

Across GOV.UK, a "survey" will pop up for one in 50 visitors, asking them what they thought of GOV.UK. This is known as the "user satisfaction survey".

Sometimes, a "small survey" or "test survey" needs to be run across GOV.UK for a short time to evaluate content changes or taxonomy changes.

This can easily be done by adding an entry to `GOVUK.userSurveys.smallSurveys` in `app/assets/javascripts/surveys.js`.

There are sections of the site that should not show any surveys and these can be controlled via the `GOVUK.userSurveys.pathInBlacklist` function in `app/assets/javascripts/surveys.js`.  They are also never shown on "done" pages which can be controlled via the `GOVUK.userSurveys.userCompletedTransaction` function in the same file.

## Example

```javascript
{
  url: 'https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/2AAAAAA/',
  identifier: 'education_only_survey',
  frequency: 50,
  template: TEMPLATE,
  activeWhen: function() {
    function sectionMatches() {
      return $('meta[property="govuk:section"]').attr('content') === 'education and learning';
    }
    function pageClassMatches() { return $('#page').hasClass('magic-content'); }

    return (sectionMatches() || pageClassMatches());
  },
  startTime: new Date("July 25, 2016").getTime(),
  endTime: new Date("August 3, 2016 23:59:50").getTime()
}
```

## About the data structure

### `identifier`
This is used both as the Google Analytics tag to record events against, and used (after being transformed to camelCase) to set a cookie so a visitor is not prompted to take the survey more than once.

### `frequency`
How frequently to show the survey. A frequency of `1` means the survey shows to every visitor. A frequency of `50` means the survey shows to 1 in 50 visitors.

### `surveyType` - OPTIONAL (default: 'url')
What type of survey is this.  Currently either `url` or `email` is supported.  `url` surveys present the user with a link that takes them direct to a survey to fill in.  `email` surveys present the user some UI to let them enter their email address and be sent more information to that address about how to take part in the survey.

### `url` - required for `url` surveys
This should link to a surveymonkey -- or other survey page -- that allows the visitor to take the survey.

### `template` - OPTIONAL
This describes the UI that the survey will use to encourage users to sign up.  If omitted the default survey for the `surveyType` will be used.

#### url survey template
An HTML fragment representing the contents of the survey box. This **MUST** conform to the following minimum structure:

```html
<section id="user-satisfaction-survey" class="visible" aria-hidden="false">
  <div class="wrapper">
    <h1>Heading copy</h1>
    <p class="right"><a href="#survey-no-thanks" id="survey-no-thanks">No thanks</a></p>
    <p><a href="javascript:void()" id="take-survey" target="_blank">Link text</a> This will open a short survey on another website</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

The `#survey-no-thanks` and `#take-survey` elements are required as the surveys code will expect these elements for setting cookies and tracking user behaviour.

#### email survey template
An HTML fragment representing the interactive UI for entering an email address.  We expect somethign like the following:

```html
<section id="user-satisfaction-survey" class="visible" aria-hidden="false">
  <div id="email-survey-pre" class="wrapper">
    <h1>Tell us what you think of GOV.UK</h1>
    <p class="right"><a href="#survey-no-thanks" id="survey-no-thanks">No thanks</a></p>
    <p><a href="#email-survey-form" id="email-survey-open" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your feedback will help us improve this website</a></p>
  </div>
  <form id="email-survey-form" action="/contact/govuk/email-survey-request" method="post" class="wrapper js-hidden" aria-hidden="true">
    <div id="feedback-prototype-form">
      <h1>We'd like to hear from you</h1>
      <p class="right"><a href="#email-survey-cancel" id="email-survey-cancel">No thanks</a></p>
      <label for="email">Tell us your email address and we'll send you a link to a quick feedback form.</label>
      <input name="survey_id" type="hidden" value="">
      <input name="survey_source" type="hidden" value="">
      <input name="email" type="text" placeholder="Your email address">
      <div class="actions">
        <button class="button">Send</button>
        <p class="button-info">We won't store your email address or share it with anyone</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  </form>
  <div id="email-survey-post-success" class="wrapper js-hidden" aria-hidden="true">
    <p>Thanks, we\'ve sent you an email with a link to the survey.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="email-survey-post-failure" class="wrapper js-hidden" aria-hidden="true">
    <p>Sorry, we’re unable to send you an email right now.  Please try again later.</h2>
  </div>
</section>
```

Behaviour will be added so that clicking the `#email-survey-open` element hides the `#email-survey-pre` container and opens the `#email-survey-form` container.  Submitting the form will hide the `#email-survey-form` container and show the `#email-survey-post-success` or `#email-survey-post-failure` container depending on what happens when submitting the form via AJAX.  The `survey_id` and `survey_source` inputs will be filled in with the appropriate elements.  The `#survey-no-thanks` and `#email-survey-cancel` are also required for dismissing the UI.  Successfully submitting the form or dismissing the UI will set cookies to avoid re-showing the UI to the user again.

### `activeWhen` - OPTIONAL
A callback function returning true or false allowing further scoping of when the survey is considered "active".

In the example above, the survey will only be considered "active" on pages with a section of "education and learning", and will not display on pages where this function evaluates to false.

Additional examples of functions which control when a survey should be active based on the current path and organisation:

```javascript
function pathMatches() {
  var pathMatchingExpr = /\/foreign-travel-advice|\/government\/world/;
  return pathMatchingExpr.test(currentPath());
}

function organisationMatches() {
  var orgMatchingExpr = /<D13>|<OT554>|<D8>|<D1196>/;
  var metaText = $('meta[name="govuk:analytics:organisations"]').attr('content') || "";
  return orgMatchingExpr.test(metaText);
}
```

Not providing the `activeWhen` argument has the same effect as setting it to `return true`. The survey will therefore apply to all pages on GOV.UK between `startTime` and `endTime`.

### `startTime` and `endTime`
The survey will only be considered "active" between these dates and times. Where an explicit time is not provided (e.g. startTime) note that JavaScript will assume 00:00:00.000 i.e. just after midnight.
